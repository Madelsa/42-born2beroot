# 42-born2beroot


The main concept of this project is to learn how to set up and work with a server and connect a client (Main PC) to the server (Virtual machine).

In this project, I have learned about the following:

1) Logical Volume Manager partitioning and its applications.
2) What SSH is and how to use it to connect the client to the server.
3) The installation of UFW and creating rules to allow interaction with ports.
4) What "sudo" is and its applications, in addition to many other useful commands.
5) How to modify the password policy for newly created users and the root user.
6) How crontab works and used it to run a script across all terminals, including client windows.
